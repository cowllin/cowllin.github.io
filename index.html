		<h2>Basics</h2>
			<div class="home">
				<p>
				<span class ="subtitle">Home</span><br />
				A sleepy suburb forty miles west of Chicago. Technically still a part of the metro area, but the abundance of <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qI8XmXFjGXc/UjSkSLCVW7I/AAAAAAAAEw4/Las7TsdBvdI/s1600/Picture+231.jpg">prairies and silos</a> makes it clear that the open Midwest plains start in earnest the next town over.

				<span class ="subtitle">School</span><br />

			<div class="work">
				<p>
				<span class ="subtitle">Work</span><br />Worked many, many paying jobs, including part-time jobs throughout four years of college. From mowing lawns to washing tables at <a href="http://chiantisingeneva.com/about/">an Italian restaurant </a>. . . from financial analysis for a private equity firm to consulting for Bain . . . from deliving late-night cookies to crafting morning crepes.

		<h2>Passions</h2>
			<div class="music">
				<p>
				<span class ="subtitle">Music</span><br />Co-founded a music-tech startup this past year, Nostrajamus. We created a platform for music listeners to predict what songs will get big. Our beta web app gained some traction and we presented at the Collision Conference in Las Vegas and met with SoundCloud. Check it out at <a href="http://nostrajamus.com/#/">nostrajamus.com</a> 
				</p>
			</div>	
			<div class="running">
				<p>
				<span class ="subtitle">Running</span><br />Ran the 2013 NYC Marathon as part of fundraising team for T1D research. Ran the Charlottesville Marathon in April 2015. Most proud of holding the family record for lap time around our 1.6 mile neighborhood. With <a href ="https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xat1/v/t1.0-9/11329785_10153339065543674_9177345148035511389_n.jpg?oh=0cb03b9ccf6c8ad7afefd290ddbfbdba&oe=55F28C4B&__gda__=1442207113_da0393e7392f65e1bd3d53182d221419">five competitive brothers and sisters</a>, this piece of pride is no joke. (Okay, actually a <i>little</i> bit of a joke. But still some pride).

			<div class="reading">
				<p>
				<span class ="subtitle">Reading</span><br />
				I just fucking love to read. Classics, nonfiction, youth fiction, newspapers, you name it. Abused my job at <a href="http://www.campuscookie.com/">a cookie store</a> to start a <i>Books 'n Bites</i> book club for 4th graders in Charlottesville to discuss groundbreaking works like <i>Maniac Magee</i> (The kids were really just there for the cookies.)
